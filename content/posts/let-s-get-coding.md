title: Let's get coding

By now your development environment should be set up and we are ready to start coding. I've thought long and hard about whether it's better to cover theory first and then move on to building real projects or to just jump in and build projects from the start, explaining the concepts as we go along.In my view it is much more effective to start building projects from the start. 

## What we will build

No to get coding, we have to have something we will build. Here it is.

Why a login form? Well, it's something all of us get to do with on a daily basis. It is also a nice introduction to the basics of HTML and CSS.

In short, before we begin, just a short introduction into web technologies. A modern web page is divided into the front-end and, where applicable, the back-end. We can also refer to the client-side and the server-side part of a web page. 

In simpler terms, let's use an example. Everyday, most of us are on Facebook. What you see on your screen is the front-end and the back-end deals with all the logic of the web page. For instance, the database of all the users on Facebook is on the back-end. If you like a post, that request is sent from the front-end to the back-end, it is written to the database and it is returned to the front-end where it shows that you liked the post. Simple right?

Now, for purposes of this site and the projects we will be doing, we will focus on the front-end. On the front-end there are basically three technologies at work. Firstly, there is HTML, in which all of the contents of the website is written. Secondly, there is CSS which is responsible for the styling of the page and, finally, there is Javascript, which provides some logic on the front-end and makes the page interactive. 

For this project we will just be building the page in HTML and CSS, with no Javascript at this stage. The form will therefore not be interactive, but this is a perfect project to illustrate the basics of HTML and CSS.

So what are we waiting for? Let's get coding!

### Step 1:

To start off we open up VSCode and we will be on the welcome page which I referred to in the previous lesson. You can proceed to close the welcome screen.

Now, somewhere on your PC, you can create a folder. It can be anywhere, it doesn't matter. You can also call the folder anything you like. Once the folder is created, open it and inside create another folder. I suggest we call this folder "Lesson 1". In that way we will have a folder for each project we build during the course of these lessons. 

Once the folders are created we can go back to VSCode. In VSCode, click on File in the top left hand corner and select the "Open Folder" option. In the dialog window that opens, search for the "Lesson 1" folder we just created and select it to open the folder in VSCode.

Your screen should now look like the screenshot above. 

Step 2:

Because are only going to work with HTML and CSS, we have to create 2 files in our folder. To create these files, hover your mouse on the "Lesson 1" in the VSCode file explorer where 4 options will appear.

Like in the screenshot, we click the first option. A new file will appear in the file explorer, allowing you to name the file.

In the box that appears, we can type index.html. That will be the homepage of our "site". You can call this file anything, but, generally, this file is called "index.html".

After the name of the file is entered, the file will open on the code editor. Once this is done, repeat this process, but name the new file "style.css". Once this is done, you should have 2 files, "index.html" and "style.css".

You'll see in my editor, I have the 2 files and both of them are open, with the active window in the code editor being "index.html".
